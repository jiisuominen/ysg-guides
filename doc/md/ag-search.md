# The Silver Searcher (ag)

## Description
**The Silver Searcher**, often abbreviated as `ag`, is a fast and efficient code-searching tool designed for developers who need to search codebases and large directories. It is similar to `ack`, but significantly faster, making it ideal for quick searches in extensive codebases.

## Features
- **High Performance**: Typically 5â€“10x faster than `ack` due to its C implementation.
- **Recursive Search**: Searches entire directories and subdirectories by default.
- **Regex Support**: Allows the use of regular expressions for flexible matching.
- **File-Type Filtering**: You can limit the search to specific file types or exclude them.
- **Customizable**: Works with custom `.ignore` files to exclude files or directories.
- **Compatibility**: Works on Linux, macOS, and other Unix-based systems.

## Installation

### Debian/Ubuntu
1. **Using APT package manager**:
   ```
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install silversearcher-ag
   ```

## Basic Usage

### Simple Search
```
ag search_term
```

### Search for a term in a specific file type
```
ag search_term --cpp
```

### Exclude directories from the search
```
ag search_term --ignore-dir=node_modules
```

## Tips
- Use `.agignore` or `.ignore` files to exclude specific files or directories.
- The command runs recursively by default, searching the entire project directory.
